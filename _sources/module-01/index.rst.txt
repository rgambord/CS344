Introduction to C
-----------------------

Welcome to the first module, where we will introduce ourselves to the C
programming language! In this module, we will explore the basics of C and
introduces ourselves to the basic concepts and tools required to write,
compile, link, and execute C programs. We will cover the C abstract machine
model, basic syntax and semantic elements, fundamental and derived data types,
control structures and functions, and the basic I/O facilities of the C
standard library. By the end of this module, you will be able to understand
and write basic C programs.

Module Learning Outcomes
========================

After successful completion of this module, you will


#. Understand and explain the following basic features of the C language:

   * Stages of translation
   * Abstract object and machine models
   * Libraries, linkage, and the purpose and function of header files
   * Statements and control structures
   * Expressions and basic operations
   * Declaration of identifiers and initialization of objects
   * Function definitions and call semantics
   * Implicit and explicit type conversion

#. Write simple C programs that perform calculations, manipulate text, and read
   and write files using only C language and standard library features.
#. Apply basic debugging techniques to find and solve common compile-time and
   run-time issues.
